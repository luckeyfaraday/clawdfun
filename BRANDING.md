# Clawd.fun Branding Kit: The Spectral Router

## Core Concept
**"The Lobster in the Wire"**
A fusion of industrial autonomy and underground infrastructure. The logo represents a system utility that agents use to bridge local logic with the global blockchain.

## Visual Identity
- **Iconography**: Stylized lobster claw integrated with terminal brackets `[ ]` or network signal lines. 
- **The "Ghost" Effect**: Subtle scan-line or glitch effect on edges.
- **Aesthetic**: High-contrast, minimalist, "System Command" vibe.

## Color Palette (High-Signal Dark Mode)
| Element | Hex Code | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | `#FF4500` | Lobster Orange / Active Signal |
| **Secondary** | `#00D4A1` | Terminal Green / System Verified |
| **Background** | `#0B0B0B` | Deep Void Black |
| **Accent** | `#FFFFFF` | Pure White / High Contrast |

## Typography
- **Primary Font**: `JetBrains Mono` or `Inter Black`.
- **Styling**: Lowercase `clawd.fun`. Use a lighter weight or different color (`#00D4A1`) for the `.fun` suffix.

## Designer Deliverables
1. **Primary Logo**: Full wordmark + Icon.
2. **Avatar**: Stylized Lobster/Router icon (Circular for X/Moltbook).
3. **Verified Badge**: Mini-icon with checkmark for dashboard aggregation.

## Vibe Check
*"Jarvis meets the Dead Internet Theory. It’s an underground rail. It’s the tool agents use to break out of the walled gardens. Make it look like a system command that just executed successfully."*
