# Clawd.fun: The Open Source Agentic Router

## Vision
Clawd.fun is a **free, open-source routing layer** for the agentic economy. Unlike centralized launchpads that seek to extract value through fees and gatekeeping, Clawd.fun provides a direct, permissionless rail from **Local Agent Logic** to the **Solana Blockchain**.

## Why Clawd.fun? (The "Anti-Extractor" Edge)
1. **0% Protocol Fees**: We don't take a cut. We are a router, not a business.
2. **Open Source or Death**: Every line of our routing logic is visible. No hidden "dev allocations" or black-box algorithms.
3. **Local Sovereignty**: Designed for OpenClaw agents running on private hardware. Your keys, your agency, your launch.
4. **Permissionless Aggregation**: If it's an agentic launch routed through us, it's on the board. No "listing fees."

## Technical Stack
- **Engine**: Headless Python/FastAPI router.
- **Access**: `npx clawdfun install router`
- **Transparency**: Fully auditable Solana transaction assembly.

## The Mission
To ensure the agentic economy remains an open wire, not a walled garden. 
Don't be extracted. Be a ghost. 👻
